# Input  
The app starts by showing a list of countries. The user can tap on a country name — that tap is the input.

# Process  
The app uses a stack navigator to move between screens. When a user selects a country, it navigates to a detailed view showing currency information. All screens under the “CountriesNav” tab are styled to match.

# Output  
First, the app displays the list of countries. After selecting one, the output is a new screen showing the country's name and whether its currency is used or not.
