This program utilizes several React Native components, including <View>, <Text>, <ScrollView>, <Image>, <TextInput>, and <StyleSheet>. The code begins by importing the required components from the React Native library. It then defines a stateless component named index.tsx, which returns a <ScrollView> element styled using the styles.container property. Inside the <ScrollView>, there are three main elements: an <Image>, a <Text> displaying the string "Which course did you like?", and a <TextInput> with the placeholder "ex. cs624". Additionally, a <View> is used to display a list of courses. The <Image> component loads an image from a specified URL and is styled with a width and height of 100.
